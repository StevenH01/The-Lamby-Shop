Before you start click the README.md file above then (when opened in github)
To make this easier to look at and follow click code instead of preview above

To begin with if you are using github for the first time here are some steps I would recommend.

**Setting up your environment:**

First:
-download vsCode
-<https://code.visualstudio.com/download>
-choose the option that works with your system

Second:
-Install git
-<https://git-scm.com/downloads>
-choose the option that works with your system

Third:
-install node.js
-<https://nodejs.org/en/download>
-choose the option that works with your system

**To have the repo in your vsCode:**
After you have everything installed and good to go

-Open vsCode
-Find "Terminal"
-click "New Terminal"
-in the terminal you type
  -git clone https://github.com/StevenH01/The-Lamby-Shop
  -exact command is above^

You should be done from here

**Making your first commit:**
When you make your first commit, please create a new branch with your name

-Command:
  -git branch (your first name)
  
-then go to the branch by going to the terminal and typing
  -git checkout (your branch name)
  
-you then publish your branch
 -git push -u origin (your branch name)

-next open up the index.html file and under the line first commite check type
  -(your first name) commit check
  
-then run the git commands
  -git add .
  -the line above will add all changes made to be ready to be commited to your branch
  
-then to commit you type
  -git commit -m "(your first name) commit check"
  
-finally run the last to git commands:
  -git pull
  -git push

From here you will have completed your first commit to the repo.

I would say make changes in here because I am going to organize it where we all will be working in our own branch and will push what we up to the main branch for future sprints.

Additionally I am also going to create presentating "sprint" branches as we progress through the class.
Once we learn more about the criteria and everything I will update the readme ore get the base template going for our project
